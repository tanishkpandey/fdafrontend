                                <p class="card-text pt-4">FDA India introduces <b>SWABHIMAAN CARD</b> to every individual and agricultural business.
                                    With this card, they will get enough credit for their farming and business activities. <br /><br />
                                    Even today, the majority of our nation's population is still dependent on agriculture, and their
                                    economic condition is still very bad. If they need money for agriculture or any other reason,
                                    then they have only two options: -
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The first is to get a loan from a bank, which is lengthy and requires a lot of paperwork.</li>
                                    <li>The second is to get money from a moneylender. The interest rate on the moneylenderâ€™s
                                        loans is very high, which makes their financial situation even worse.</li>

                                            of farming that improve the overall well-being of the community. For instance, they
                                            can utilise latest machines or technologies that reduce water consumption and improve
                                            soil health. This means farmers can grow more food without damaging the soil.

                                            happens to their crops or products taken on debt, the insurance will help them get back
                                            on their feet.
